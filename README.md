# I am an enjoyer of the coding

Hi! I like to make small fun things in code and also make games. I code mainly in PHP and Javascript but I'm also ok at many other languages.

You can check me out on the github website: [tomiy](https://github.com/tomiy)

## Projects

Right now i'm working pretty much exclusively on [openrider](https://github.com/tomiy/openrider) which is the last link in a pretty long chain of reboots of freerider, a bike riding game where players draw tracks and race on them.

I also made a [bookmark popup](https://github.com/tomiy/home-extension) and a [PHP CLI twitch bot](https://github.com/tomiy/crossbladebot).
